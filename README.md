I am excited to announce that I am open-sourcing my code on GitHub. Originally intended as a personal assistant, this system has evolved into a social media suggestion tool based on feedback from friends. I am now planning to enhance it into a standalone system with a web interface.

With time, the tool will become more general-purpose oriented. Utilizing AI, it will be able to summarize all news streams and provide you with a concise overview, allowing you to add your personal touch to your tweets and schedule them to be posted at your preferred times.

This system gathers data from multiple sources and transforms it into comprehensive topics. It facilitates the creation of posts, tweets, and even drawings and images.

All you will need is to provide the necessary keys it needs to run.

Currently, the system is still in its research phase, with most of the existing code reflecting fast-paced, exploratory research. All new updates will be continuously added to the repository.

If you feel like you want to help or contribute, please contact me at Ahmedsedeeek@gmail.com.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves!
